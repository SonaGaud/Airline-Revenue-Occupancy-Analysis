## **Prerequisites**
      - Ensure the following are installed:
      - Python 3.x
      - sqlite3
      - Jupyter Notebook
      - Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
# **Business Problem**
      - Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines.
      Key challenges include:
      - Stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased 
        labor costs, and rising fuel prices.
      - Profitability is under pressure, and the goal is to increase 
        occupancy rates to boost profits.
# **Main Challenges**
      - Stricter environmental regulations raise costs and limit expansion potential.
      - Higher flight taxes reduce demand by increasing travel costs.
      - Tight labor market increases labor costs and turnover rates.
# **Objectives**
      - Increase occupancy rates to boost profit per seat.
      - Develop pricing strategies aligned with market conditions.
      - Enhance customer experience to improve loyalty.
# Approach & Technologies Used
      - Python & SQL Combination: Leveraged Python (with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) for data analysis and visualization, and SQL for querying the aircraft database to analyze booking trends, revenue, and pricing.
      - SQL Queries: SQL was used extensively to extract and manipulate data, helping to identify key metrics such as aircraft occupancy rates, revenue per flight, and the relationship between fares and ticket sales.
      - Data Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis using both Python and SQL to examine booking patterns, revenue generation, and customer preferences over time.
# **Basic Analysis**
      - Insights into aircraft with over 100 seats and their actual seat counts.
      - Line chart analysis shows trends in ticket bookings and revenue over time.
      - Bar graph compares average costs for business, economy, and comfort fares.
# **Key Findings**
      - Aircraft SU9 generates the highest revenue due to lower ticket prices.
      - Aircraft CN1 earns the least revenue, likely due to poor conditions and limited fare options.
      - Higher occupancy rates correlate with increased revenue and reduced costs.
# **Conclusion**
      - Optimize pricing strategies to balance affordability and profitability.
      - Focus on improving aircraft conditions and services to attract more customers.
      - Increase occupancy rates without compromising safety and service quality.
